# Claims Dashboard (Healthcare RCM)

This project demonstrates:
- Core KPIs for billing/collections (Total Billed, Paid, Allowed, AR Days, Denial Rate)
- DAX measures for financial and operational performance
- A star schema model (fact_claims with payer, date, and facility dimensions)
- Performance Analyzer screenshots (before/after) to show optimization

**Why it matters:**  
Interviewers often hyper-focus on Performance Analyzer/DAX.  
In practice, real performance gains come from **data modeling and architecture**.  
This dashboard documents both the diagnosis and the fix.
